Broad claims have been made about the `robustness' of various digital
watermarking method. Unfortunately the criteria as well as the pictures used to
demonstrate these claims vary from one system to the other and recent attacks
show that the robustness criteria used until now are inadequate: JPEG
compression, additive Gaussian noise, low pass filtering rescaling and cropping
have been addressed in most the literature but specific distortions such as
rotation have been rarely addressed. In some cases the watermark is simply
said to be ``robust against common signal processing algorithms and geometric
distortions when used on some standard images.'' 

Most of the potential attacks detailed in:

   Martin Kutter and Fabien A. P. Petitcolas. A Fair Benchmark for Image
   Watermarking Systems. To be presented at the 11th Annual Symposium on
   Electronic Imaging, IS&T/SPIE, San Jose, USA, 23-29 January 1999.

are actually implemented into this version of StirMark: given a watermarked
image, StirMark will apply these transformations with various parameters.
Then the ouput images can be tested with watermark detection or extraction
programs. The full process can be automised using a simple batch file.

StirMark reads and writes arbitrary images in the PGM, PPM and JPEG file
formats. The selection is based on the extension of the file only: .ppm,
.pgm, .jpg or .jpeg



----------------------------
What's new with version 3.0?
----------------------------

Version 3.0 adds:
- New transformations including row and columns removal, shrearing in X
  and Y direction and sharpening.
- Color quantisation (used by GIF) support based on Jef Poskanzer's code.
- Laplacian based removal attack using Richard Barnett's.
- Basic quality measure functions: SNR and PSNR.
- Better JPEG support for input image including simple autodection of
  the input format based on file extension (pgm, ppm, jpg or jpeg).

---

Version 2.3 now uses the bi-quadratic resampling algorithm instead of the
Nyquist interpolation algorithm used in previous version. The speed improvement
is roughly a factor 8 to 9 for a 700x500 image. The bi-quadratic algorithm gives
a result similar to the bi-cubic in about 60% of the CPU time. It is described
into:

   Neil Dodgson, "Quadratic Interpolation for Image Resampling,"
   IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 6, no. 9,
   pp. 1322--1326, Sept. 1997.

---

Version 2.2 adds the following command line option to version 1.0
  -T<name> to perform a standard series of tests on a single image.
  -R<float> and -b<float> are used in the enhanced distortion process.
These options are described in details below.

Version 2.2 now uses the JPEG library of the Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG.
For convenience this library is provided in the StirMark package but the latest
version can be dowloaded from: 

   <ftp://192.48.96.9/graphics/jpeg/>

So the default output now uses the JPEG format:

   stirmark test.ppm output.jpg

just applies the latest StirMark distortions to the image, including JPEG
compression at the end.



--------------------
Command line options
--------------------

You can specify an input and an output file name in the command line. If you 
omit any of those, stdin and stdout are used instead respectively. The output 
uses the JPEG format. 

  -i<float>   The number of pixel distances that the corner of the target
              image is allowed to be inside the original image. If the
              number is followed by %, then the maximum corner shift
              is defined as a percentage of the image width or height,
              whichever is smaller. Default is -i2.0%.

  -o<float>   The number of pixel distances that the corner of the target
              image is allowed to be outside the original image
              (default 0.7). Sample values taken from outside the
              original image are extrapolated. You can also specify a
              percentage as with -i, but this is normally not useful
              as -o values much higher than 1 cause mostly useless
              extrapolations.

  -d<float>   The maximum byte value by which any of the RGB values
              of any pixel is allowed to deviate from the original
              value (default 1.5).

  -s<int>     Seed value for the random number generator. If you do
              systematic measurements with StirMark, then repeat the
              runs with different -s values (e.g. from -s1 to -s100),
              to get significant results regarding the probability with
              which StirMark breaks your steganographic technique.

  -R<float>   The fraction of pixel displacement allowed for any pixel.
              During the distorsion process, any pixel can be moved
              randomly along both axes.

  -b<float>   The number of pixel displacement allowed for the center
              of the image. All the pixel are moved using a smooth 
              function. Pixels at the corners are not moved while the
              pixel in the center of the image is moved the most.
              This is similar to a `punch/pinch' effect.

  -PSNR<name> Gives the PSNR of the input file compare to the file whose
              name is provided after the PSNR option:
			  stirmark  -PSNRoriginal.ppm  modified.jpg

  -NOJPEG     The default StirMark attack includes a mild JPEG comppresion
              after the geometrical distortions. This option disables the
			  compression.

  -T<name>    Ignores all other options and performs a series of tests.
              The tests implemented by default into StirMark include:
                - rotation by a small angle and cropping: -2, -1,
                  -0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2 degrees. This simulates in part
                  what is obtain when scanning an image: it is impossible
                  to align it perfectly.
                - rotation by a small angle followed by cropping and
                  rescaling to keep the original size of the image.
				- rotation by large angle: 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 90 degrees.
                - scaling by factors 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1.1, 1.5 and 2.
                - centered cropping: 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%,
                  25%, 50% and 75%
                - median filtering
                - gaussian filtering   1  2  1
				                       2  4  2
									   1  2  1
                - horizontal flip
                - original `StirMark'
				- sharpening
				- colour quantization
				- FMLR attack
                - `StirMark' with randomisation and bending
                - JPEG compression with auality factors: 90, 85, 80, 75, 
                  60, 50, 25, 15 and 10
				- shearing (X or Y direction): 1% and 10%
				- line and column removal: 1, 5, 10 (#)
              Output files are in JPEG and PPM formats, depending on
              the test.

			  Other information about these tests, how to use them can be
			  found on:

			  <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/watermarking/benchmark/>


For example 

   stirmark -Tbase test.ppm

will create 110 files with base name "base" and different suffixes and 
extensions depending on the transformation applied.

You can still use the "original StirMark command line": 

   stirmark -i0 -o0 -d0 test.ppm output.jpg

does not apply any distortion apart JPEG compression.



--------------------------
About StirMark distortions
--------------------------

Although many watermarking systems survive basic manipulations -- that is, 
manipulations that can be done easily with standard tools, such as rotation,
shearing, resampling, resizing and lossy compression -- they do not cope with
combinations of them and especially minor random geometric distortions.

StirMark is a testing tool for watermarking systems that applies such
distortions to images. The image is slightly stretched, sheared, shifted and/or 
rotated by an unnoticeable random amount. If A, B, C and D are the corners of 
the image, a point M of the said image can be expressed as M = a(b A + (1 - b)D)
+ (1 - a)(b B + (1 - b)C) where 0 <= a, b <= 1 are the coordinates of M
relatively to the corners. The distortion is done by moving the corners by a 
small random amount in both directions. The new coordinates of M are given by
the previous formula, keeping (a, b) constant.

More distortions -- still unnoticeable -- can be applied to a picture. A global
`bending' is applied to the image: in addition to the general bi-linear property
explained previously a slight deviation is applied to each pixel, which is
greatest at the center of the picture and almost null at the borders. On top of
this a higher frequency displacement of the form l.sin(Ox.x)sin(Oy.y) + n(x,y)
-- where n is a random number -- is added.

All these distortions combined together with a mild JPEG compression do not 
remove the watermark per se. They prevent the detector from finding it. This 
suggests that the real problem is not so much inserting the marks as recognizing
them afterwards.

StirMark introduces a practically unnoticeable quality loss in the image if it 
is applied only once. However after a few iterated applications of the 
algorithm, the image degradation becomes soon very noticeable. This makes 
StirMark (especially the -d option) also a model for algorithms that can be 
applied to artificially degrade images on replay to get rid of the 
lossless-copying property of digital multimedia objects.

Suggestions for improving this software are always welcome. We are also 
interested in robustness test results obtained by processing with StirMark 
images that were marked with various available watermarking tools.

Surprisingly, first experiences with various watermarking tools show that the 
watermarks of *all* tools we have been able to locate until today can be 
removed or made undetectable by StirMark. For more information, please see:
